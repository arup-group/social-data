# Arup Social Data
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/arup-group/social-data/run.py)

This is a repository for collection and analysis of open social data. This type of data can be useful to planners, NGO's, governments, firms, and anyone trying to address social problems through data.

## Workflows
This repository currently two primary workflows:

1. Data Explorer: View and analyze all the data in the database at the county or census tract level. You can also download a selection of the data as an Excel file for further analysis. 
2. Equity Explorer: identify vulnerable and historically under-served geographies at the census tract level.
3. Eviction Analysis: Conduct a specific analysis of the relative risk of eviction for a selection of counties. 

These workflows support a number of use cases, including:

- Determining which areas of a city have the most access to transportation
- Providing context to determine how to distribute direct assistance to families in one or more counties
- Comparing different variables across datasets to see how they're correlated, such as household income and educational attainment.
- Generating out per capita or per square mile indicators such as concentration of houses per square mile in a county
- Overlaying public transportation routes on top of indicators like median income
- Comparing the relative risk of eviction between counties

There are three ways to interact with this data.
- Web interface - You can use the interactive UI either on the web or run locally
- Python scripts - Include functions to gather, clean, and analyze data to output a relative risk ranking for multiple counties. Can be extended with your own scripts. 
- Custom SQL Queries - SQL that you write to get the most recent data from our database and use however you want. 

## No code, no problem
Not a developer? Just don't want to code today? No problem! You can access the data using our web app at the link below.

[https://share.streamlit.io/arup-group/social-data/run.py](https://share.streamlit.io/arup-group/social-data/run.py)

## Python Usage
We've done our previous analyses in Python, and have built data gathering, cleaning, and analysis functions.

The `credentials.py` file is configured to allow read-only access to an Arup-maintained database of the most recent relevant FRED data. In addition to using these Python scripts, you can connect to this database and run direct SQL queries to get the data you want.

DB_PASSWORD = password
```

## About the data
We currently have 56 tables in the database, representing over 2 million rows of data.

This data is the most recent data we could get, but some datasets are updated more frequently than others. Some datasets are at the county level and some are at the census tract level. The following datasets are currently in the database:

### What is Relative Risk?
Relative risk is an index used to compare counties against each other in our Python analysis. It is _not_ a measure of absolute or percentage risk and has no meaning outside of this analysis. We use this to compare counties to understand where people are more at risk of eviction. 

We calculate this using a custom formula to balance socioeconomic factors with the policy response of a city. There are three parts of this formula: a *socioeconomic index* value calculated from the combination of normalized FRED data and other data sources in the table above, a *policy index* value found using the policy Excel sheet in this repository and using methodology adapted from EvictionLab, and the *time remaining* until protections end. The equation is

`relative_risk = socioeconomic_index * (1 - policy_index) / sqrt(time_remaining)`

In this equation, we aim to minimize socioeconomic risk on the top of the fraction, maximize the policy response value and take 1 minus the index value calculated (to represent that better policy constitutes less relative risk), and maximize the time remaining on the bottom of the fraction. The square root of the time remaining is used to represent how additional time has diminishing returns. For example, the different between having 2 days and 2 weeks until protections expire is much different than whether policies expire in 3 months or 4 months when we think about how to prioritize one county over another.   

### What is cost of evictions?

To calculate the cost to avoid evictions the following calcuation was used:

`(burdened_household_proportion / 100) * county_rent * housing_stock_distribution percentage * population * (burdened_households_proportion / 100)`

Housing stock distributions (US Census) were used to evaluate the types of houses that exist in the United States (e.g. studio, one bedroom, etc.).  Burdened household proportions were decided by Arup and were used to determine what percentage of people were most at risk.  Proportions were set at 5, 25, 33, 50, and 75 to represent that not all burdened households will face eviction, and we don't know how many actually will.  With the chosen proportion values, we are representing a general range, knowing there isn't a case where nobody will be evicted, or a case where everybody will be evicted.  These numbers can be adjusted based on the user's knowledge of their own county. County rents for each housing stock were sourced from HUD, and used Fair Market Rates to determine rent prices for each stock.  Fair Market Rents (FMRs) represent the estimated amount (base rent + essential utilities) that a property in a given area typically rents for. Burdened households was a percentage calculated by FRED which gives the percentage of the population who pay more than 30% of their income on rent.  Population data was pulled from HUD and represents the population by county in the year 2017. 

Performing this calculation for each proportion and each housing stock will calculate the amount needed to prevent eviction for each proportion.  The total cost of evictions for a particular county for one month was calcuated by summing each housing stock.  To get the cost of prevention for more than one month, the sum was multiplied by the number of months of interest. 

This script uses Fair Market Rent values.  Median rent values are also available in the database.  The script can be manually adjusted by the user to reference median rent values rather than fair market rent if they choose.  

Upon script completion, an excel file will be created within the output folder displaying all values mentioned above.  If you experience problems with the script or have questions about methodologies, please reach out to a member of the development team.  

### How are Equity Geographies identified?
"Equity Geographies" are census tracts that have a significicant concentration of underserved populations, such as households with low incomes and people of color. By identifying historically underserved communities, planning and funding can be targeted to enable more equitable access to transportation. 

Equity Geographies must meet at least one of the following 2 criteria. This methodology is based on the equity priority community [methodology](https://bayareametro.github.io/Spatial-Analysis-Mapping-Projects/Project-Documentation/Equity-Priority-Communities/#summary-of-mtc-epc-demographic-factors--demographic-factor-definitions) developed by the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC).       
    A) Census tracts have a concentration of BOTH people of color AND low-income households
    B) Census tracts have a concentration of three or more of the remaining six equity indicators AND a concentration of low-income households

All of the equity indicators considered in the analysis are here:
    1) People of Color
    2) 200% Below Poverty Level
    3) People with Disability
    4) Age 19 or Under
    5) Age 65 of Over
    6) Limited English Proficiency
    7) Single Parent Family
    8) Zero Vehicle Household

Equity geographies are compared against concentration thresholds as defined below. The coefficient value varies on user input. 
    `concentration threshold = average + (standard deviation * coefficient)`

### How is the Transportation Vulnerability Index created?
First, values for each of the indicators are normalized across the entire region. The script uses preprocessing.MinMaxScaler() to normalize values. Index values are the sume of the normalized values times the corresponding weights of each selected indicator. 

### FRED Queries
You can get the most recent Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) using the following commands:

`python -m queries`

#### Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--table`| Specifies a table that you want to query. If none is given, will return all tables.|
| `--ouput`| Specifies an output type, without a ".". Currently, only `pk` or `xlsx` are supported. `pk` returns a pickled `pandas.DataFrame`. If none is given, will default to `xlsx`.|

#### Purpose

This command will query the eviction data database, and return data in an `Output` folder. If no folder exists, will be created by the `queries.py` script.

### Policy Workbook
Included in this repository is a template Excel file for policy data. This file is referenced in the Python scripts. There are three pages to be aware of.

#### Policy Timeline
This page is used to keep track of time-dependent policies and generate a "countdown clock" for a county. You can add policies and their expirations to end up with a date where people lose protections. You can also color the cells on this page to show where different policies overlap and how their expirations line up visually.  

#### Policy Ranking
This page is used to collect and represent the specific policy nuanced not captured by the timeline. For each county, enter a `1` in each cell where a policy applies. These values are weighted according the methodology used by EvictionLab (with a couple minor modifications) to get an index score for each county.

#### Analysis Data
This page collects the results from the previous two pages in a format that can be more easily read by the Python scripts. You may need to copy the countdown and policy index values for each county you're analyzing.

We would love for you to use this code, build on it, and share with others. See [our contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)  for more information.

### Issues
Please post bugs, errors, and questions to the Issues tab of this repository.

### Code
Make a pull request with your feature or bug fixes and we will review it. You're free to merge once it's been approved.

### Policy Data
Policy data is some of the most useful, but also the hardest to get. We've shared policies for a number of counties we've analyzed in the Bay Area and Tulsa area. We hope that as you do policy analysis for your area, you'll contribute that back so others can use and verify it. 

For now, to submit your data, open an issue in this repository and submit your policy data (countdown and/or policy ranking) for the county or counties you're looking at.
